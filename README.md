# TriviaGame

For this assignment I was tasked with creating a trivia game with a countdown timer for each question. I choose a theme of "The Office" because it is one of my favorite TV shows. 

For this game the user starts by clicking the "Start" button. A question and 4 possible answers appear and a visual timer starts counting down. If the user selects the correct answer they are shows 5 seconds of a positive GIF from The Office. If they select an incorrect answer, they are shown 5 seconds of a negative GIF, and if the timer reaches 0 they are also shown a negative GIF. After the GIF has played for 5 seconds the next question appears and the timer resets. At the end of the quiz the user is shown how many correct answers they had and how many incorrect. 

To achieve this I used the following languages/technologies: 

HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
JavaScript
jQuery
